- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlderStoresWordsOfMagic
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring more about programming and project management, and learning more about Github.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning FTL's brand of XML and Lua.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a mod for a mod of that game, learning as I go.
- 📫 How to reach me: Discord. Email is something I might check, but it's rare.
